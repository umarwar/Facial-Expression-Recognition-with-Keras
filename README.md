# Facial-Expression-Recognition-with-Keras

  In this project, our goal is to develop a facial expression recognition model using the Keras framework. We will build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) from scratch to classify facial expressions into seven categories: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral. The model will be deployed to a web interface using Flask, allowing real-time facial expression recognition on video streams and image data


1.	Develop a facial expression recognition model in Keras.
2.	Build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN).
3.	Deploy the trained model to a web interface with Flask.
4.	Apply the model to real-time video streams and image data
